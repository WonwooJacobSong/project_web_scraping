"""
This project is a Python script that utilizes web scraping to gather information from various websites. 
It includes functionalities to retrieve today's weather in Toronto from Google, display today's news in Toronto from a local news website, 
and provide the current standings of Premier League teams. The script uses the requests library to make HTTP requests, 
BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and involves functions for each of the three main features.
